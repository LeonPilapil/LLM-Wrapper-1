# Deployment Status Update

## ✅ Dependency Conflict Fixed

### What Was Changed

Updated `my-app/package.json` to fix dependency conflict:
- **Changed**: `zod` from `^4.1.12` to `^3.25.76`
- **Reason**: OpenAI SDK requires zod v3, causing build failures on Vercel

### Verification

✅ **Local npm install successful** - No dependency conflicts  
✅ **Changes committed** - Ready to push  
⚠️ **Local build has pre-existing TypeScript error** - Not related to zod change

The TypeScript error in `ChatInterface.tsx` is a separate issue that needs to be fixed.

### Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** once code is pushed

3. **Watch the build logs** to verify:
   - ✅ npm install completes without ERESOLVE errors
   - ✅ Build process starts
   - ⚠️ May encounter the TypeScript error that needs fixing

### Important Notes

- The zod dependency conflict is now **RESOLVED**
- Vercel build should pass the `npm install` step
- If TypeScript errors appear, they need to be fixed separately
- Make sure **Root Directory** is set to `my-app` in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure **OPENAI_API_KEY** environment variable is set

### Remaining Issues

1. **TypeScript Error**: `ChatInterface.tsx:100` - Type error with `EXPERT_METADATA` indexing
   - This existed before the zod change
   - Needs to be fixed separately

## Summary

The deployment block caused by the zod dependency conflict has been fixed. The code is ready to push, and Vercel should successfully install dependencies and build the app (pending the TypeScript fix).
