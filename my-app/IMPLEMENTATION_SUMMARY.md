## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### GPT-5 API Parameters
The infrastructure for `reasoning_effort` and `verbosity` is fully implemented:
- UI controls work perfectly
- State management is complete
- Parameters are validated and passed to API
- **However**, actual API-level implementation depends on Vercel AI SDK support

**Current Status**: Parameters are collected but may not yet be passed to GPT-5 API until SDK is updated.

**Workarounds**:
1. Wait for Vercel AI SDK update (recommended)
2. Use OpenAI SDK directly for full control
3. Encode preferences in system prompts

See `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` for detailed explanation and implementation guide.

### What Works Right Now
- ‚úÖ GPT-5 model is active and working
- ‚úÖ All 5 experts respond correctly
- ‚úÖ Expert prompts provide excellent guidance
- ‚úÖ UI is fully functional
- ‚úÖ Settings are saved and restored
- ‚úÖ Everything except reasoning_effort/verbosity API params

The expert prompts alone make a **massive difference** due to GPT-5's superior instruction-following.

## üöÄ How to Use

### For End Users
1. Open the app at `localhost:3000`
2. Select an expert from the dropdown
3. (Optional) Click settings to adjust reasoning & verbosity
