# Quick Start Guide - GPT-5 Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your GPT-5 Expert Wrapper has been successfully migrated to use OpenAI's Responses API with full support for GPT-5 parameters!

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
```

This will install the new `openai` package (v4.80.0) required for GPT-5 Responses API.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `my-app` directory:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**Important:** Make sure your OpenAI account has GPT-5 access enabled!

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Backend (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- ✅ Replaced Vercel AI SDK with **OpenAI SDK directly**
- ✅ Using **Responses API** (not Chat Completions)
- ✅ Full support for `reasoning.effort` parameter (minimal, low, medium, high)
- ✅ Full support for `text.verbosity` parameter (low, medium, high)
- ✅ Proper error handling for GPT-5 specific issues

### Frontend (`app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Replaced streaming with **non-streaming responses**
- ✅ Custom message state management
- ✅ Loading states with animated indicators
- ✅ All GPT-5 settings properly passed to API
- ✅ Maintains localStorage persistence
- ✅ Clickable example prompts

### Dependencies (`package.json`)
- ✅ Added `openai` package (v4.80.0)
- ✅ Kept existing UI dependencies

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Test the following to ensure everything works:

1. **Basic Chat**
   - [ ] Type a message and get a response
   - [ ] Response appears in the chat
   - [ ] Error handling works (try with invalid API key)

2. **Expert Types**
   - [ ] Switch to UX/UI Designer - ask about design
   - [ ] Switch to Business Analyst - ask about processes
   - [ ] Switch to Content Writer - ask for copywriting
   - [ ] Switch to Product Manager - ask about roadmaps
   - [ ] Switch to Marketing Strategist - ask about campaigns

3. **GPT-5 Parameters**
   - [ ] Open Settings (⚙️ icon in header)
   - [ ] Change Reasoning Effort to "minimal" - responses should be faster
   - [ ] Change Reasoning Effort to "high" - responses should be more thorough
   - [ ] Change Verbosity to "low" - responses should be concise
   - [ ] Change Verbosity to "high" - responses should be detailed

4. **Persistence**
   - [ ] Change expert type and GPT-5 settings
   - [ ] Refresh the page
   - [ ] Settings should be restored from localStorage

5. **UI/UX**
   - [ ] Example prompts are clickable
   - [ ] Loading animation appears while waiting
   - [ ] Messages scroll smoothly
   - [ ] Markdown renders correctly (try asking for code)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'openai'"
- Run `npm install` in the `my-app` directory

### "GPT-5 model access error"
- Check that your OpenAI API key is valid
- Verify your account has GPT-5 access (may require waitlist approval)
- Try using `gpt-5-mini` or `gpt-5-nano` in `app/api/chat/route.ts` if GPT-5 isn't available yet

### "API key error"
- Ensure `.env.local` exists with `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Restart the dev server after adding environment variables

### Responses are slow
- Try setting Reasoning Effort to "minimal" or "low"
- Consider using `gpt-5-mini` for faster responses (change model in API route)

## 📊 GPT-5 Models Available

You can switch models in `app/api/chat/route.ts` (line 67):

```typescript
const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: 'gpt-5',        // Options: 'gpt-5', 'gpt-5-mini', 'gpt-5-nano'
  // ... rest of config
});
```

- **`gpt-5`** - Full reasoning model (best quality, slower)
- **`gpt-5-mini`** - Faster responses, good reasoning
- **`gpt-5-nano`** - Fastest, minimal reasoning

## 🎉 What's Next?

Your GPT-5 wrapper is now fully functional! Here are some ideas:

1. **Add Streaming**: Implement Option B from the plan for word-by-word responses
2. **Add More Experts**: Follow the guide in `README.md` to add new expert types
3. **Customize UI**: Adjust colors, layouts, and styles in Tailwind
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to Vercel with `vercel deploy` (environment variables will be needed)

## 🔐 Security Note

Your API key is now properly secured:
- ✅ Never exposed to the browser
- ✅ Only used in serverless API routes
- ✅ Loaded from `.env.local` (not committed to git)

**Never commit `.env.local` to version control!**
